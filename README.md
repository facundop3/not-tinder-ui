A Tinder like UI set of components for react-native

## Installing git hooks on your local repo:
In order to get this we included a simple sh script that copies the hooks on the `scripts/git-hooks` on the `.git/hooks` folder of this repo and makes them executables.
You just need to run: ```sh  sh scripts/install-hooks```
