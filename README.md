A Tinder like UI set of components for react-native

## Installing git hooks on your local repo:
In order to get this we included a simple sh script that copies the hooks on the `scripts/git-hooks` on the `.git/hooks` folder of this repo and makes them executables.
You just need to run: ```sh scripts/install-hooks``` on the root directory of this repo.

ü§™ If you get an error when running this command, you can just copy the content of the `scripts/git-hooks` folder on the `.git/hooks` folder of this repo. Then you'll need to make those files executables by running `chmod +x .git/hooks/*` on the terminal (remember to be steped on the root directory of this repo)
